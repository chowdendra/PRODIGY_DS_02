**Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Dataset**

For Task 2 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on a dataset of my choice, following the guidelines provided. The primary focus was to explore relationships between variables and uncover patterns and trends in the data.

**Tools and Libraries Used**
Jupyter Notebook,
Pandas,
NumPy,
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations.

The following steps were undertaken during this task:
**Data Cleaning:**

Addressed missing values in key columns such as Age, Cabin, and Embarked.
Identified and removed duplicates.
Handled outliers in numerical variables where appropriate.

**Exploratory Data Analysis:**

Analyzed relationships between variables such as Survived, Pclass, Age, Fare, and Sex.
Created visualizations like bar charts, box plots, and heatmaps to identify trends and correlations in the data.
Highlighted patterns, such as survival rates by passenger class and gender.
